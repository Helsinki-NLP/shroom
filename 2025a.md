Welcome to the official shared task website for SHROOM-CAP, a [CHOMPS 2025](https://chomps2025.github.io/) shared task!

SHROOM-CAP stands for "**S**hared-task on **H**allucinations and **R**elated **O**bservable **O**vergeneration **M**istakes in **C**rosslingual **A**nalyses of **P**ublications".
SHROOM-CAP will invite participants to detect hallucination in the outputs of LLMs in a scientific context. 
This shared task extends our previous iteration, SHROOM, with a few key changes: 
- We focus on LLM outputs for scientific domain;
- We're looking at crosslingual setting with both high-resource languages such as, English, Spanish, French, Hindi and suprisal low-level languages;
- Participants will have to detect if hallucination occurs or not.

_The information on this website is subject to change._ 
We will send announcements for any major update on the [Google group mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/shroomcap).

#### What is SHROOM-CAP?
The task consists of detecting presence of scientific hallucinations. 
Participants are asked to determine if a given scientific text produced by LLMs constitute hallucinations.
The task is held in a cross-lingual setting, i.e., we provide data in multiple mixed languages produced by a variety of public-weights LLMs.´

In practice, we provide an LLM output (as a string of characters, a list of tokens, and a list of logits), and participants have to predict if the LLM output string contains a hallucination (binary classification).

Participants are free to use any approach they deem appropriate, including using external resources, and work on any subset of languages they are interested in.

#### How will participants be evaluated?
Participants will be evaluated for performing binary classification to identify cases of scientific hallucinations. This will be done using via macro-F1 score for two criterions:
(i) Factual Mistakes and (ii) Fluency Mistakes

Rankings and submissions will be done separately per language.

#### Participant info
To participate, the participants need to register via [https://forms.gle/hWR9jwTBjZQmFKAE7](https://forms.gle/hWR9jwTBjZQmFKAE7). This form will enable us add the participants on the google group for further communication.

#### ** NEW **: Submission Platform
Participants will be able to submit their solutions and see the leaderboard on this platform : [https://shroomcap.pythonanywhere.com/](https://shroomcap.pythonanywhere.com/)
