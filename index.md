Mu-SHROOM will invite participants to detect hallucination spans in the outputs of instruction-tuned LLMs in a multilingual context. 
This shared task builds upon our previous iteration, SHROOM, with a few key changes: 
- We're looking at multiple languages: Arabic (Modern standard), Chinese (Mandarin), English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Swedish;
- We're now focusing on LLM outputs;
- Participants will have to predict where the hallucination occurs.

_This website is under construction_. More information will be available soon.
