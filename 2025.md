Welcome to the official shared task website for Mu-SHROOM, a [SemEval-2025](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2025/) shared task!

Mu-SHROOM stands for "**Mu**ltilingual **S**hared-task on **H**allucinations and **R**elated **O**bservable **O**vergeneration **M**istakes".
Mu-SHROOM will invite participants to detect hallucination spans in the outputs of instruction-tuned LLMs in a multilingual context. 
This shared task builds upon our previous iteration, SHROOM, with a few key changes: 
- We're looking at 14 languages: Arabic (Modern standard), Basque, Catalan, Chinese (Mandarin), Czech, English, Farsi, Finnish, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Spanish, and Swedish;
- We're now focusing on LLM outputs;
- Participants will have to predict where the hallucination occurs.

_The information on this website is subject to change._ 
We send announcements for any major update on the [Google group mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/semeval-2025-task-3-mu-shroom) and the [shared task Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/shroom-shared-task/shared_invite/zt-2mmn4i8h2-HvRBdK5f4550YHydj5lpnA).

#### What is Mu-SHROOM?
The task consists in detecting spans of text corresponding to hallucinations. 
Participants are asked to determine which parts of a given text produced by LLMs constitute hallucinations.
The task is held in multi-lingual and multi-model context, i.e., we provide data in multiple languages and produced by a variety of public-weights LLMs.´

In practice, we provide an LLM output (as a string of characters, a list of tokens, and a list of logits), and participants have to compute, for every character in the LLM output string, the probability that it is marked as a hallucination.
Participants are free to use any approach they deem appropriate, including using external resources, and work on any subset of languages they are interested in.

#### How will participants be evaluated?
Participants will be ranked along two (character-level) metrics: 
1. intersection-over-union of characters marked as hallucinations in the gold reference vs. predicted as such
2. how well the probability assigned by the participants' system that a character is part of a hallucination correlates with the empirical probabilities observed in our annotators.

Rankings and submissions will be done separately per language.

Participants can also download the scoring program on its own [here](./scorer.py) for reference and developing their systems.

**The evaluation phase is now over! Congrats and thanks to all the participating teams.**
You can check the official rankings [at this page](/shroom/2025/iou_rankings), which is how we will report the results of this shared task. Alternatively, you can also see [this page](/shroom/2025/cor_rankings) to have a look what the rankings would be if we ranked teams by how well their probability mass correlates with our annotations.

We are releasing a participant kit, which we'll keep building up. It contains the scoring program, a format checker, as well as two baselines: a random baseline and an XLM-R based system. The latter is a very naive system and is mostly meant for demonstration purposes (in particular how to convert character-level labels into wordpiece-level tags and vice-versa).
